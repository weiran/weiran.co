I'm Weiran Zhang, I'm a Software Engineering Manager at Capital One working in Mobile.

My passions in technology lie with iOS and .NET technologies, and I'm a keen supporter of open source software. Most of my [side projects](/projects) are open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/weiran), and I encourange contributions to them by making them as accessible as possible.

I host a .NET meetup in Nottingham called [dotnetnotts](https://www.meetup.com/dotnetnotts/), which has been running for over five years. 

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing squash and have been a member of [Racketeers](http://notts-squash.co.uk/results.html?table=teams&idd=1468), a team in the Nottinghamshire Leagues for eight years.
