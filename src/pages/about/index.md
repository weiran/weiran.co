I'm Weiran Zhang, a Senior Software Engineering Manager at Capital One working on modernisation of our mobile app and its platform.

Most of my [side projects](/projects) are open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/weiran), and I encourage contributions to them by making them as accessible as possible.

I co-founded a .NET meetup in Nottingham called [dotnetnotts](https://meetup.com/dotnetnotts/) in 2014 and hosted it monthly until 2020.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing mountain biking and squash. I've been a member of [Racketeers](hthttps://nottssquash.leaguemanagersq.com/?table=teams&idd=2183tp://notts-squash.co.uk/results.html?table=teams&idd=1468), a team in the Nottinghamshire Leagues for over 10 years.
