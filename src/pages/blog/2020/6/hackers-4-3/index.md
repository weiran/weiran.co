Hackers 4.3 ships today and is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hackers-for-hacker-news/id603503901).

One of the most requested features has been the ability to open Hacker News links in the app. In this release I've added a share extension which helps you opens Hacker News links in Hackers. 

I've highlighted the two different ways in this screenshot, either via the share extension (top) or the action extension (below).

Hacker News links in comments will also open them in app, rather than sending you to the Hacker News website.
